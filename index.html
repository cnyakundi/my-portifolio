    <p>
        I am a Kenyan based Blogger who has an interest in politics, news and social justice. I have a degree in Actuarial Science from the Jomo Kenyatta University of Science and Technology. I decided to take coding at Moringa school because the world is changing
        and coding skills are very important in day to day activities. As a Blogger, coding will help me maintain my websites, and server as I keep doing my stuff.
