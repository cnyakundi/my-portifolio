        <p>
            I am a Kenyan based <strong>Blogger</strong> who has an interest in politics, news and social justice. I have a degree in Actuarial Science from the Jomo Kenyatta University of Science and Technology. I decided to take coding at <em>Moringa school</em>            because the world is changing and coding skills are very important in day to day activities. As a Blogger, coding will help me maintain my websites, and server as I keep doing my stuff.
